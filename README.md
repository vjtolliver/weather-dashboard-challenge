# weather-dashboard-challenge

## Description

This project is intended to give weather updates in your area. You'll be able to search for any city you like and you'll be presented with the current weather conditions along with the next five day's forecast as well. For the forecast you'll see the temperature for everyday at 12pm, an icon of the upcoming weather, the humidity levels, and the wind speeds expected. Your search history will appear on the screen for easy access to search it again. There are also preprogrammed popular cities listed as well that you can press and search at all times.

## Usage 
In the Search History Box type in any city, or press one of the cities already listed to display the current weather conditions and five day forecast for that location.
